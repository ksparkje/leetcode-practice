# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
# Medium
#
# Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s,
# find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s.
# If there isn't one, return 0 instead.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
# Follow up:
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which
# the time complexity is O(n log n).
